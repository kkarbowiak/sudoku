# Sudoku solver

This project is a simple Sudoku solver. Currently it does not contain any fancy algorithms nor heuristics and just uses brute-force approach.

It finds all the solutions to the given puzzle (instead of just a single one).

I use this project as an exercise in profiling the code, finding hot-spots, and improving performance.
